This project is my attempt to experience some technologies I've been long interested in.A simple TicTacToe game was selected for simplicity, my focus is on:-A ReSTful API using ServiceStack. ServiceStack is great and I would recommend taking a look: https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack-Some first steps into NoSQL - this API has Redis as a DB. I am aware this may not be the exact fit for this project, but it's chosen for the sake of learning.The Redis client is also of the ServiceStack Suite - ServiceStack.Redis - https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis-Later on I will add clients using various technologies
